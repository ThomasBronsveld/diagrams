# object-oriented-diagrams
OOAD &amp; stuff

This repository will contains all the diagrams I will create for educational purposes.

The diagrams will usually be UML diagrams and ERD. 

These types of diagrams will be grouped in folders usually containing readme's describing a use case for the diagram.
